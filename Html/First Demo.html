	<h1 class="Hello">Hello and welcome</h1>
	
	<p>In html "p" is used to add paragraphs just as I did here. It helps to make your work look nicer just like in word processing applications</p>
	<p>The "Title" of your code will appear at the top of the screen and not in the webpage itself.</p>
	<img src="IMG-20200428-WA0035.jpg" height= 200 width= 250>
	<p>//Img is used to upload an image//</p>

	<a href="https://www.twitter.com/fredluggard">Click to follow me on twitter</a>
	<p>"a" is used to insert links in html </p>
	<ul>List of Things to Buy</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Mouse pad</li>
		<li>Indomie</li>
		<li>Bread</li>
		<li>Egg</li>
		<li>Milk</li>
		<li>Butter</li>
		<li>Sugar</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In HTML "ul" is used for unordered list while "li" is used inside it to list</p>
	<p>"ol" is used for ordered list; here the list will appear in numbers</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Fred</li>
		<li>Francis</li>
		<li>Henry</li>
		<li>Ford</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To combine HTML and CSS together you have to link them together by adding "link" after the "title"</p>
	<p>Let apply color to this webpage</p>
	<p class="Info">Fredluggard</p>
	<p>"span" is used to write on the same line without starting a new paragragh. The helps when you want to apply some effect on the previous paragragh without it taking effect on the new line. An example can be seen below</p>
	<span>Red</span> Black
	<p>"div" is used to divide things and bring them to a new line and for formatting a tag inside it at once using 'stile' and  'class'</p>
	<div>Food</div> Drink <div>Cloth</div> Shoes <div>Work</div>Bus
	<p>"center" is for bringing your write up to the center of the page (Centralization)</p>
	<center>Column</center>
	<p>"br" is used to break a line it can be used instead of adding a new paragraph while "hr" is for horizonal lines</p><br>Forever
	<hr>Flight
	<p></p>
	<span>Hi</span> Bye
	<div>Food</div> Drink <div>Cloth</div> Shoes
	<div style="color: blue;">Cool right? 
	</div> div was used here;
	<span style="color: orange;">Orange</span> Green
	<p>The "strong" tag is used to make things bold.</p>
	<p>Like <strong>very bold</strong></p>
	<p>While "em" tag is for italics.</p>
	<p><em>Take Emily to Italy</em></p>
